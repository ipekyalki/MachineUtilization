# Machine Utilization

The script includes handyful ways of creating, subsetting, adding/removing, visualizing, analyzing and interpreting the data 
taken from one of the largest coal terminals in the world. The dataset contains the hourly utilization of stackers, reclaimers 
and stacker/reclaimers.

The dataset and methods belong to the 3rd section of "Advanced Analytics In R For Data Science Course" taught by Kirill Eremenko.
Besides that, I added meaningful and useful explanations for each line of code to better analyze what's going on in each step.
